Overview
--------

This application allows users to generate detailed descriptions of images. Users can upload local images or provide URLs to web images, which will be processed and described using advanced AI technology.

Architecture
-----------

The system consists of the following components:

1. **Web Application**: The central interface where users can upload or link to images
2. **Image Recognizer**: Processes uploaded images and extracts visual information
3. **Description Generator**: Creates natural language descriptions based on image analysis
4. **Langchain Chat Model**: Provides the language processing capabilities
5. **Langsmith**: Monitors and improves the quality of generated descriptions

Workflow
--------

1. A user uploads a local image or provides a URL to a web image
2. The web application sends the image to the image recognizer
3. The recognizer processes the image and extracts key visual features
4. The description generator receives this data and, using the langchain chat model, creates a detailed natural language description
5. Langsmith monitors the process and provides feedback to improve the language model's performance

Features
--------

- Support for both local image uploads and web image URLs
- Advanced image recognition capabilities
- Natural language descriptions powered by large language models
- Continuous improvement through Langsmith monitoring

Requirements
-----------

- Web browser with JavaScript enabled
- Internet connection
- Supported image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.)
- Python 3.8+

Installation
-----------

1. Clone the repository:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/RohitPawar001/Image-Descripter.git

2. Create a virtual environment:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Set up environment variables:

   Create a ``.env`` file in the project root with the following content:

   .. code-block:: 

      GOOGLE_API_KEY=google_generative_api_key
      LANGSMITH_API_KEY=LANGSMITH_API_KEY
      LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
      TAVILY_API_KEY=tavily_api_key
